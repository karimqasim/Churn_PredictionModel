<h1>Predicting Customer Churn</h1>
Customer Churn is the loss of clients or customers. Telephone service companies often use customer churn analysis as one of their key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one. In this project I try to model contracutal Customer Churn using telecom data. 

This model could be useful for potential telecom companies trying to understand the drivers of churn. You can see the model code and explanations in the `notebooks` folder.


<h2>Telecom Data</h2>
This IBM Sample Dataset acquired from Kaggle has information about Telcom customers. Each row represents a customer, and each column contains customer’s attributes described in the Metadata.

Basic information:

The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (19 features features).

The “Churn” column is our target.

11 missing values in TotalCharges column.
